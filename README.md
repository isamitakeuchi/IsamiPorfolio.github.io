# IsamiT_Porfolio

Welcome to my porfolio repository. My name is Isami Takeuchi and I am a recent graduate of a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a Concentration in Cyber Security and a Minor in General Business.
I have a passion for helping people and am looking to start my career as a SOC Analyst so I will be documenting my progress over time here.
Cyber Security is amazing and all but don't tell anyone but I am a pro soccer player at heart <3.
